# go-rasterzen

![](docs/images/20180615-rasterd-1.png)

Tools for rendering raster tiles derived from Nextzen (Mapzen) Vector tiles.

## Important

This package uses a two-pass process to convert a Nextzen vector tile to an SVG
document with embedded CSS style information and then to convert that SVG
document to a PNG file. It uses (a patched version of) the
[geojson2svg](https://github.com/whosonfirst/geojson2svg) and
[oksvg](https://github.com/srwiley/oksvg) packages respectively to do this.

To read about this package being used in production you should read the following blog posts:

* [Maps (and map tiles) at SFO Museum](https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/blog/2018/07/31/maps/)
* [Sweet spots between the extremes](https://millsfield.sfomuseum.org/blog/2018/11/07/rasterzen/)

Some important caveats:

* There is only mimimal support for styling. [See below](#styles) for details.

* Labels... it's easiest just to not even think about them yet.

* There is caching but only minimal cache invalidation, and it's still kind of buggy.

## Install

You will need to have both `Go` (specifically version [1.12](https://golang.org/dl/) or higher) and the `make` programs installed on your computer. Assuming you do just type:

```
make tools
```

All of this package's dependencies are bundled with the code in the `vendor` directory.

## Tools

### rasterd

```

#### Using `rasterd` with caches

`rasterd` support caching using one or more providers that implement the
[go-whosonfirst-cache](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-whosonfirst-cache)
`cache.Cache` interface. Caches are checked (and set) in the following order in `rasterd`: go-cache, fs-cache, s3-cache

There is currently nothing that looks like sophisticated cache invalidation. That's left up to you to do manually, for now. 

Currently filesystem, S3 and in-memory (using [go-cache](https://github.com/patrickmn/go-cache)) caches are
supported. You can invoke `rasterd` with multiple cache providers if you want.

Both the raw Nextzen tiles and the cropped "rasterzen" tiles are cached as is
the output of each provider that `rasterd` is invoked with. For example:

```
$> ll ./cache/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 wof  staff  96 Jun 12 12:29 nextzen
drwxr-xr-x  3 wof  staff  96 Jun 12 12:29 png

2018/11/01 12:36:29 OK {12 1206 1463}
...and so on
```

Or, if you've deployed `rasterd` as a AWS Lambda function (see below) you can use that function as your tile seed "worker". For example:

```
$> ./bin/rasterzen-seed -mode extent -extent '-122.405228 37.604481 -122.355044 37.645194' -min-zoom 2 -max-zoom 16 -nextzen-apikey {NEXTZEN_APIKEY} -seed-worker lambda -lambda-function {LAMBDA_FUNCTION} -lambda-dsn 'credentials={AWS_CREDENTIALS} region={AWS_REGION}' -seed-png
15:50:58.758870 [rasterzen-seed] STATUS Time to seed tile ({16 10489 25361}) 948.46835ms
15:50:58.802463 [rasterzen-seed] STATUS Time to seed tile ({16 10488 25364}) 1.600181332s
15:50:58.802491 [rasterzen-seed] STATUS Time to seed tile ({16 10490 25369}) 1.605183373s
15:50:58.802499 [rasterzen-seed] STATUS Time to seed tile ({16 10485 25362}) 1.604714453s
15:50:58.802506 [rasterzen-seed] STATUS Time to seed tile ({16 10490 25368}) 1.598768809s
15:50:58.987440 [rasterzen-seed] STATUS Time to seed tile ({16 10484 25364}) 4.284314644s
15:50:59.010505 [rasterzen-seed] STATUS Time to seed tile ({15 5246 12684}) 4.306041647s
15:50:59.010518 [rasterzen-seed] STATUS Time to seed tile ({15 5242 12685}) 1.222798064s
... and so on
```

Note that in the example above we haven't specified any local caching sources, as we did in the first example, so tiles will be rendered in AWS and cached (or not) depending on how your Lambda function is configured.

Essentially what the second example is doing is pre-seeding an S3 cache which might be something you'd want to do if you want to serve `PNG` tiles but a) don't want to suffer what the (sometimes very long) wait times generating raster tiles or b) don't want to deal with the hoop-jumping around images and AWS Lambda / API Gateway integrations (see below).

#### seed-tileset-catalog-dsn

The `seed-tileset-catalog-dsn` parameter defines how tiles to be seeded are catalogued. By default an in-memory catalog is created using `sync.Map` but if you have a lot of tiles to seed this can rapidly cause out-of-memory problems. The `seed-tileset-catalog-dsn` parameter expects a `catalog=CATALOG` property followed by (0) or more `key=value` properties, all separated by whitespace.

##### catalog=sqlite

You must also pass the following key/value pairs:

* `dsn=DSN` - Any valid DSN string that is accepted by the [go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) package.

##### catalog=sync

No additional key/value pairs are required.

### rastersvg

Utility tool to (re) render a directory of SVG tiles from a directory of `rasterzen` (GeoJSON) tiles.

```
./bin/rastersvg -h
Usage of ./bin/rastersvg:
  -destination string
    	The path to a directory to SVG tiles in.
  -dryrun
    	Go through the motions but don't write any files to disk.
  -force
    	Re-build already existing SVG files.
  -source string
    	The path to a directory containing rasterzen (GeoJSON) tiles.
  -svg-options string
    	The path to a valid RasterzenSVGOptions JSON file.
```

### rasterpng

Utility tool to (re) render a directory of PNG tiles from a directory of (rasterzen) SVG tiles.

```
./bin/rasterpng -h
Usage of ./bin/rasterpng:
  -destination string
    	The path to a directory to write PNG tiles in.
  -dryrun
    	Go through the motions but don't write anything to disk.
  -force
    	Re-render already existing PNG files.
  -source string
    	The path to a directory containing (rasterzen) SVG tiles.
```

### RasterzenSVGOptions

```
type SVGStyle struct {
	Stroke        string  `json:"stroke"`
	StrokeWidth   float64 `json:"stroke_width"`
	StrokeOpacity float64 `json:"stroke_opacity"`
	Fill          string  `json:"fill"`
	FillOpacity   float64 `json:"fill_opacity"`
}

type RasterzenSVGStyles map[string]SVGStyle

type RasterzenSVGOptions struct {
	TileSize      float64            `json:"tile_size"`
	Stroke        string             `json:"stroke"`
	StrokeWidth   float64            `json:"stroke_width"`
	StrokeOpacity float64            `json:"stroke_opacity"`
	Fill          string             `json:"fill"`
	FillOpacity   float64            `json:"fill_opacity"`
	Styles        RasterzenSVGStyles `json:"styles"`
}
```

The default RasterzenSVGOptions are:

```
	opts := RasterzenSVGOptions{
		TileSize:      512.0,
		Stroke:        "#000000",
		StrokeWidth:   1.0,
		StrokeOpacity: 1.0,
		Fill:          "#ffffff",
		FillOpacity:   0.5,
	}
```

Here's an example JSON file encoding SVG options:

```
{
    "tile_size": 512.0,
    "stroke": "#515151",
    "stroke_width": 1.0,
    "stroke_opacity": 1.0,
    "fill": "#000000",
    "fill_opacity": 0.2
}
```

#### Styles

Rasterzen does not support complex or sophisticated styling, nor does it have a robust query mechanism for doing so. Anything is possible but chances are it never will. It has "just enough" to do "just enough" which may not be enough for you, depending on your circumstances.

The following SVG styling attributes are supported:

* [stroke](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke)
* [stroke_width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-width)
* [stroke_opacity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/stroke-opacity)
* [fill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill)
* [fill_opacity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-opacity)

Default, or global, values are set at the root of the `RasterzenSVGOptions` and can be reset via the `styles` property which is a dictionary whose keys are query statements and whose values are dictionaries containing style details.

Currently supported query statements are:

* `"geometry.type={GEOMETRY_TYPE}": { ... }`
* `"properties.{PATH}={VALUE}": { ... }`

There is limited support for boolean queries in the _values_ of individual queries. For example:

* `properties.landuse_kind=[apron,parking]` would match any feature whose `landuse_kind` was "apron" or "parking".
* `properties.landuse_kind=(apron,parking)` would match any feature whose `landuse_kind` was both "apron" and "parking"... which in a Nextzen context is actually impossible (because `landuse_kind` is a singleton) but you get the idea.

For example:

```
{
    "tile_size": 512.0,
    "stroke": "#515151",
    "stroke_width": 1.0,
    "stroke_opacity": 1.0,
    "fill": "#000000",
    "fill_opacity": 0.0,
    "styles": {
	"geometry.type=[Polygon,MultiPolygon] properties.kind=[ocean,water,lake]":{
	    "stroke": "#515151",
	    "stroke_width": 1.0,
	    "stroke_opacity": 1.0,
	    "fill": "#000000",
	    "fill_opacity": 0.2
	},
	"properties.landuse_kind=[apron,aerodrome]": {
	    "stroke":"#ffffff",
	    "stroke_width": 1.0,
	    "stroke_opacity": 1.0,	    
	    "fill": "#f11499"
	    "fill_opacity": 0.0	    
	},
	"geometry.type=[Polygon,MultiPolygon] properties.landuse_kind=[apron,aerodrome]": {
	    "stroke":"#ffffff",
	    "stroke_width": 1.0,
	    "stroke_opacity": 1.0,
	    "fill": "#f11499",
	    "fill_opacity": 0.2
	}		
    }
}
```

_A note about overriding default styles: As of this writing you need to specify all the `fill` and `stroke` attributes rather than just those you want to override. It shouldn't be this way but it is necessary because of the way that Go unmarshals JSON in to structs. There is [an open ticket](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-rasterzen/issues/19) to address this._

Which would end up looking like this:

![](docs/images/rasterzen-styles.png)

By default all queries in a query statement must evaluate to true in order for a style to be applied. It is not possible (yet) to perform boolean `OR` queries on full query statements, like this:

```
"[properties.landuse_kind=aerodrome,properties.kind=building]" : {
	// styles go here
}	
```

Note that as of release `0.1.3` support for the following properties in `RasterzenSVGOptions` has been removed:

```
	DopplrColours bool   `json:"dopplr_colours"`
	FillIfMatches []string `json:"fill_if_matches"`
```	


## Lambda

Yes, it is possible to run `rasterd` as an AWS Lambda function.

To create the Lambda function you're going to upload to AWS simply use the handy `lambda` target in the Makefile. This will create a file called `deployment.zip` which you will need to upload to AWS (those details are out of scope for this document).

Your `wof-staticd` function should be configured with (Lambda) environment variables. Environment variables map to the standard command line flags as follows:

* The command line flag is upper-cased
* All instances of `-` are replaced with `_`
* Each flag is prefixed with `RASTERD`

For example the command line flag `-server-uri` would be mapped to the `RASTERD_SERVER_URI` environment variable. Which is a good example because it is the one environment variable you _must_ to specify for `rasterd` to work as a Lambda function. Specifically you need to define the protocol as... "lambda://". For example

```
RASTERD_SERVER_URI = lambda://
```

In reality you'll need to specify other flags, like `RASTERD_S3_DSN` and `RASTERD_CACHE_OPTIONS`. For example here's how you might configure your function to render all the data and graphics formats (but not static HTML webpages) for your data:

```
RASTERD_SERVER_URI = lambda://
RASTERD_S3_CACHE = true
RASTERD_S3_OPTS = ACL=public-read
RASTERD_S3_DSN = bucket={BUCKET} prefix={PREFIX} region={REGION} credentials=iam:
```

### Lambda, API Gateway and images

In order for requests to produce PNG output (rather than a base64 encoded string) you will need to do a few things.

1. Make sure your API Gateway settings list `image/png` as a known and valid binary type:

![](docs/images/20180625-agw-binary.png)

2. If you've put a CloudFront distribution in front of your API Gateway then you
will to ensure that you blanket enable all HTTP headers or whitelist the
`Accept:` header , via the `Cache Based on Selected Request Headers` option (for
the CloudFront behaviour that points to your gateway):

![](docs/images/20180625-cf-cache.png)

3. Make sure you pass an `Accept: image/png` header when you request the PNG rendering.

4. If you add another image (or binary) handler to this package you'll need to
repeat steps 1-3 _and_ update the `BinaryContentTypes` dictionary in
[server/lambda.go](server/lambda.go) code accordingly. Good times...

#### Lambda, API Gateway and images... and Leaflet

![](docs/images/20180713-rasterd-leaflet.png)

The good news is that it works. You can use PNG tiles produced by `rasterd`
inside a normal [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) `Tile` layer. The bad news is
that you need to use the bundled
[L.TileLayer.Lambdazen.js](javascript/L.TileLayer.Lambdazen.js) 
package (or equivalent) to do so, like this: 

```
// <script type="text/javascript" src="L.TileLayer.Lambdazen.js"></script>
	
var url = 'https://{SOME-LAMBDA-API-GATEWAY-URL}/png/{z}/{x}/{y}.png?api_key={API_KEY}';
var layer = new L.TileLayer.Lambdazen(url, { maxZoom: 16 });
	
var map = L.map('map').setView([37.613858, -122.37366], 15);
layer.addTo(map);

This [redefines the default `createTile`
method](https://leafletjs.com/examples/extending/extending-2-layers.html) to
fetch the tile in question with the correct `Accept:` header discussed above and
then hands the resulting image back to Leaflet. Computers, right... ?

## Docker

Yes. There is a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for the `rasterzen-seed` tool.

### ECS (AWS)

The detailed details of using the above mentioned Dockerfile with the AWS ECS service are outside the scope of this document but your container will need an IAM role with the following (minimum) built-in policies:

* `AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role`

Additionally, if you plan to use the SQS `seed-worker` you'll need to add a policy for sending messages to the SQS queue in question. For example:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sqs:SendMessage",
                "sqs:GetQueueUrl",
                "sqs:GetQueueAttributes"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:sqs:{AWS_REGION}:{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:{SQS_QUEUE}"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

If you are going to use the Lambda `seed-worker` you'll need to add a policy for invoking the Lambda function in question. For example:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowLambdaRasterzenSeeder",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "lambda:InvokeFunction",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:{AWS_REGION}:{AWS_ACCOUNT_ID}:function:{LAMBDA_FUNCTION}"
        }
    ]
}
```

Your role should have the following trust relationship:

```
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

Finally, assuming you haven't baked a specific `rasterzen-seed` command in to your container image you would invoke it as a (ECS) task with a "container override" like this:

```
/usr/local/bin/rasterzen-seed,-seed-max-workers,25,-nextzen-apikey,{NEXTZEN_APIKEY},-seed-worker,sqs,-sqs-dsn,credentials=iam: region={AWS_REGION} queue={SQS_QUEUE},-seed-all,-min-zoom,14,-max-zoom,16,-timings,-mode,extent,-extent-separator,;,-extent,-122.632141;37.220487;-121.555481;37.982092
```

_See the commas between everything and the lack of quotes around the `-sqs-dsn` flag and the need for an `-extent-separtor` flag and the part where the extent is separated by a semi-colon? I love that about Docker and ECS..._

The command above will calculate all the tiles between zoom levels 14 and 16 and contained by the extent (-122.632141,37.220487,-121.555481,37.982092) and then "fetch" each one of those tiles using the SQS `seed-worker` which just means an entry for the tile will be created in an SQS queue and assumes you've configured the `go-rasterzen` [rasterzen-seed-sqs](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-rasterzen/blob/master/cmd/rasterzen-seed-sqs/main.go) tool as a Lambda trigger for new queue items.

For a pretty picture of everything just described, see [go-rasterzen/docs/rasterzen-seed-sqs-arch.jpg ](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-rasterzen/blob/master/docs/rasterzen-seed-sqs-arch.jpg).

Because this (`rasterzen-seed`) is being run from an ECS instance you could also invoke the Lambda `seed-worker` directly rather than queueing everything up in SQS. That's your business. The point is you can do either. In both cases though it's assumed that there is a Lambda `seed-worker` that is fetching data from a copy of the `go-rasterzen` [rasterd](https://github.com/whosonfirst/go-rasterzen#rasterd) application.
