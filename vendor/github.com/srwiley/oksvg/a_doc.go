// The oksvg package provides a partial implementation of the SVG 2.0 standard.
// It can perform all SVG2.0 path commands, including arc and miterclip. It also
// has some additional capabilities like arc-clip. Svgdraw does
// not implement all SVG features such as animation or markers, but it can draw
// the many of open source SVG icons correctly. See Readme for
// a list of features.
